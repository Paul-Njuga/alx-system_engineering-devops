## Description :bookmark_tabs:

This project is an intro to the Webstack debugging series that trains you in the art of debugging.

In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks will be given to you, the final goal is to come up with a Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state. But before writing this Bash script, you should figure out what is going on and fix it manually.
