## Description :bookmark_tabs:

This project is an intro to the Webstack debugging series that trains you in the art of debugging.

In this debugging series, using your debugging skills, find out what’s keeping your Ubuntu container’s Nginx installation from listening on port 80. Then, write a Bash script with the minimum number of commands to automate your fix.
